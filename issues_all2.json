So that we don't just point to some random line within the component.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the technique in #33136.\r\n\r\nThis technique is now really better than the fake throw technique, when available. So I now favor the owner technique. The only problem it's only available in DEV and only if it has a child that's owned (and not filtered).\r\n\r\nWe could implement this same technique for the error that's thrown in the fake throwing solution. However, we really shouldn't need that at all because for client components we should be able to call `inspect(fn)` at least in Chrome which is even better.",

So this is now correctly simplified to `true`:\r\n```js\r\n`` === \"\" // now true\r\n`a${1}` === \"a1\" // now true\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf a template string literal can only partially be comptime-evaluated, it is not that useful for dead code elimination or further constant folding steps and thus, is left as-is in that case. Same is true if the literal contains an array, object, symbol or function.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nSee added tests.\r\n",

When that information is available.\r\n\r\nI adjusted the fake function code generation so that the beginning of the arrow function aligns with these as much as possible.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that when the browser tries to look up the line/column of the enclosing function, such as for getting the function name, it gets the right one. If we can't get the enclosing line/column, then we encode it at the beginning of the file. This is likely to get a miss in the source map identifiers, which means that the function name gets extracted from the runtime name instead which is better.\r\n\r\nAnother thing where this is used is the in the Performance Track. Ideally that would be fixed by https://issues.chromium.org/u/1/issues/415968771 but the enclosing information is useful for other things like the function name resolution anyway.\r\n\r\nWe can also use this for the \"View source for this element\" in React DevTools.

Flagged behind `enableHydrationChangeEvent`.\r\n\r\nIf you type into a controlled input before hydration and something else rerenders like a setState in an effect, then the controlled input will reset to whatever React thought it was. Even with event replaying that this is stacked on, if the second render happens before event replaying has fired in a separate task.\r\n\r\nWe don't want to flush inside the commit phase because then things like flushSync in these events wouldn't work since they're inside the commit stack.\r\n\r\nThis flushes all event replaying between renders by flushing it at the end of `flushSpawned` work. We've already committed at that point and is about to either do subsequent renders or yield to event loop for passive effects which could have these events fired anyway. This just ensures that they've already happened by the time subsequent renders fire. This means that there's now a type of event that fire between sync render passes.",

That way you can reflect the new value in state to bring it in sync. It does this whether controlled or uncontrolled.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that this should be ok to replay because it's similar to the continuous events in that it doesn't replay a sequence but only reflects the current state of the tree.\r\n\r\nSince this is a breaking change I added it behind `enableHydrationChangeEvent` flag.\r\n\r\nThere is still an additional issue remaining that I intend to address in a follow up. If a `useLayoutEffect` triggers an sync rerender on hydration (always a bad idea) then that can rerender before we have had a chance to replay the change events. If that renders through a input then that input will always override the browser value with the controlled value. Which will reset it before we've had a change to update to the new value.",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n`nonce` option is mentioned in `ReactDOM.preloadModule` documentation https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/preloadModule, but I found that it has no effect. This looks like an minor oversight and this is a one liner fix PR.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\nAdded a new test \"ReactDOMFloat > preloadModule > supports nonce\" in `packages/react-dom/src/__tests__/ReactDOMFloat-test.js`, which is a `preloadModule` equivalent of an existing test \"ReactDOMFloat > preload > supports nonce\".\r\n",

What was happening is that the `getContextRefOperand()` helper wasn't following aliases. If an operand had a context type, we recorded the operand as the context place — but instead we should be looking through to the context places of the abstract value.\n\nWith this change the fixture now fails for a different reason — we infer this as a mutation of `params` and reject it because `params` is frozen (hook return value). This case is clearly a false positive: the mutation is on the outer, new `nextParams` object and can't possibly mutate `params`. Need to think more about what to do here but this is clearly more precise in terms of which variable we record as the context variable.",

In particular we model RSC aborts for prerenders as unfinished streams where models awaiting a value will never get them. This sets the stage for resuming RSC renders in the future where we can expect a concategnation and continuation of the RSC result picking up the holes left by the aborted prerender. Prerender is already an unstable API and there is no future for the non-halting semantics so this commit lands the flag.\r\n\r\nThis change doesn't remove the flag entirely because halt semantics are also available while prerendering Fizz in the experimental channel. This API is not unstable and is more widely used so when we adopt the experimental behavior in a canary we should be closer to releasing the next major",

The performance has dramatically improved.

The warning only appears in development mode and doesn't affect production builds.\r\n\r\nTest results confirm the implementation works as expected:\r\n1. Warning shows in development mode when second parameter is used\r\n2. No warning appears when used correctly (single parameter)\r\n3. No warnings in production mode",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nI have a class where I need to contribute to an open source project. Since I am new to GitHub and open source, I made a very minor change to a comment that I didn't understand so that it made sense to me. \r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\nNo testing needed, just a comment change.\r\n",

But the error message is really good (nice job @mofeiz): the only catch is that in theory the inferred dep could be a temporary that can't trivially be reported to the user.\n\nBut the messages are really useful for quickly verifying why the compiler couldn't preserve memoization. So here we switch to outputting a detailed message about the discrepancy btw inferred/manual deps so long as the inferred dep root is a named variable. I also slightly adjusted the message to handle the case where there is no diagnostic, which can occur if there were no manual deps but the compiler inferred a dependency.",

    "body": "This RFC proposes reintroducing Server Context for React Server Components to provide a way to share values across components (including async components) without prop drilling.\r\n\r\n## Motivation\r\n\r\nServer Components introduce async rendering patterns which seems to require a specialized context solution. The absence of such a mechanism causes several problems:\r\n\r\n1. **Prop drilling becomes unavoidable** - Even components that don't need certain data must receive and forward it\r\n2. **Component composition becomes difficult** - Deep hierarchies require threading props through every level\r\n3. **Third-party libraries face unique challenges** - UI component libraries cannot use global state and need self-contained ways to share configuration\r\n\r\nThis is especially problematic for component library authors who:\r\n- Cannot rely on global application state\r\n- Need to share configuration across complex component hierarchies\r\n- Must remain encapsulated and independent of application-specific globals\r\n\r\n## Proposed Solution\r\n\r\nA set of APIs specifically designed for Server Components:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nfunction createServerContext<T>(defaultValue: T, displayName?: string): ServerContext<T>;\r\nfunction useServerContext<T>(context: ServerContext<T>): T;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Implementation\r\n\r\nThe implementation leverages Node.js's `AsyncLocalStorage` to maintain context across async boundaries:\r\n\r\n1. Server Context uses a distinct `$$typeof` symbol (`REACT_SERVER_CONTEXT_TYPE`)\r\n2. Values are stored in a Map within AsyncLocalStorage\r\n3. The API maintains React's familiar Provider pattern while handling async operations seamlessly\r\n\r\n`AsyncLocalStorage` is already used successfully in React for resource resolution in server rendering, making it a proven solution for this purpose.\r\n\r\n## Key Use Cases\r\n\r\n- **Component configuration** - Complex UI components (DataGrids, etc.) can share settings across their hierarchy\r\n- **Multi-tenant UI** - Different sections of an app can use different theme/locale settings\r\n- **Server resources** - Authentication, request data, and database connections can be available throughout the tree\r\n\r\n## Performance Considerations\r\n\r\nAsyncLocalStorage has minimal overhead and is optimized in Node.js:\r\n- Creates small, short-lived map instances\r\n- Only updates at render time, not during request processing\r\n- Offers better performance characteristics than alternatives like prop drilling\r\n\r\n## Drawbacks\r\n\r\n- Server-only API - requires distinct patterns from client components\r\n- Requires AsyncLocalStorage or equivalent in the runtime\r\n- Adds complexity to the React API surface\r\n\r\n## Alternatives Considered\r\n\r\n1. **Prop drilling** (status quo)\r\n2. **Global mutable state** (violates React principles)\r\n3. **Function composition** (deviates from component model)\r\n4. **Client components with regular Context** (loses RSC benefits)\r\n\r\n## Unresolved Questions\r\n\r\n1. Serialization strategy for hydration\r\n2. Interaction with Suspense boundaries\r\n3. Support for non-Node.js environments\r\n4. Potential bridge mechanisms to Client Context\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- [Server Context Deprecation PR](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/27424)\r\n",

This is actually just revisiting a validation I built a while ago to disallow mutable functions at frozen locations, but I tried to make it much more precise this time to avoid false positives.\r\n\r\nWe detect function expressions which are *known* mutable — they definitely can modify a variable defined outside of the function expression itself (modulo control flow). This uses types to look for known Store and Mutate effects only, and disregards mutations of refs or mutations that we aren't sure about (untyped function calls for example). Any such known-mutating function passed to a location with a Freeze effect is reported as a validation error.\r\n\r\nThis is behind a flag and disabled by default. If folks agree this makes sense to revisit, i'll test out internally and we can consider enabling by default.",

This means that we also don't alias the function with its mutable captures.\r\n\r\nThis case is tricky, because we don't generally know for sure what is a mutation and what may just be a normal function call. For example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nhook useFoo() {\r\n  const x = makeObject();\r\n  return () => {\r\n    return readObject(x); // could be a mutation!\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf we pessimistically assume that all such cases are mutations, we'd have to group lots of memo scopes together unnecessarily. However, if there is definitely a mutation:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nhook useFoo(createEntryForKey) {\r\n  const cache = new WeakMap();\r\n  return (key) => {\r\n    let entry = cache.get(key);\r\n    if (entry == null) {\r\n      entry = createEntryForKey(key);\r\n      cache.set(key, entry); // known mutation!\r\n    }\r\n    return entry;\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen we have to ensure that the function and its mutable captures alias together and end up in the same scope. However, aliasing together isn't enough if the function and operands all have empty mutable ranges (end = start + 1).\r\n\r\nThis pass finds function expressions and object methods that have an empty mutable range and known-mutable operands which also don't have a mutable range, and ensures that the function and those operands are aliased together *and* that their ranges are updated to end after the function expression. This is sufficient to ensure that a reactive scope is created for the alias set.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The alternative is to reject these cases. However, even if we do that we likely won't be able to flip the validation on immediately, so I think it still makes sense to have the compiler do the more-correct thing in the invalid case. Especially considering that there are examples, like with pure caching, that technically violate the rules but are pure in practice.",

    "body": "Stacked on #33073.\r\n\r\nReact semantics is that Suspense boundaries reveal with a throttle (300ms). That helps avoid flashing reveals when a stream reveals many individual steps back to back. It can also improve overall performance by batching the layout and paint work that has to happen at each step.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we never implemented this for SSR streaming - only for client navigations. This is highly noticeable on very dynamic sites with lots of Suspense boundaries. It can look good with a client nav but feel glitchy when you reload the page or initial load.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the Fizz runtime to be throttled and reveals batched into a single paint at a time. We do this by first tracking the last paint after the complete (this will be the first paint if `rel=\"expect\"` is respected). Then in the `completeBoundary` operation we queue the operation and then flush it all into a throttled batch.\r\n\r\nAnother motivation is that View Transitions need to operate as a batch and individual steps get queued in a sequence so it's extra important to include as much content as possible in each animated step. This will be done in a follow up for SSR View Transitions.",

I came across this bug while trying to deduce the cause of a significant amount of re-renders. In the react dev tools it showed the component was indeed auto-memoized, however it would still re-rerender when seeing the same props. When removing `for await` from my code the component properly memoized inputs. \n\nLater I tested this in the react compiler playground and noticed the very clear `Todo: (BuildHIR::lowerStatement) Handle for-await loops (10:12)` error message. Ideally this error could be addressed or surfaced to the user in order to prevent confusion on why a component marked as auto-memoized isn't actually being memoized.\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n19.1\n\n### What version of React Compiler are you using?\n\nrc",

This only exists because of `completeBoundaryWithStyles`. Normally if there's a server-side error we'd emit the `clientRenderBoundary` instruction instead. This adds unnecessary code to the common case where all styles are in the head. This is about to get worse with batching because client render shouldn't be throttled but complete should be.\r\n\r\nThe first commit moves the client render logic inline into `completeBoundaryWithStyles` so we only pay for it when styles are used.\r\n\r\nHowever, the approach I went with in the second commit is to reuse the `$RX` instruction instead (`clientRenderBoundary`). That way if you have both it ends up being amortized. However, it does mean we have to emit the `$RX` (along with the `$RC` helper if any `completeBoundaryWithStyles` instruction is needed.",

Specifically from https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/32950#issuecomment-2837887871, it sounds like Babel by default emits source map information for all nodes, even when they don't have a `loc` property set. Code coverage tools then pick up the synthesized source location information for this, leading to the issue described.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't super clear how to omit nodes from the source map. A few google searches didn't turn up any documented way to do so: the user can do so via a function supplied to babel, but plugins can't. Entire files can be opted out, but not nodes. I asked an LLM which answered that explicitly setting `node.loc = null` omits the node from source maps, but that didn't work. \r\n\r\nWhat did work was explicitly setting the `loc` property to an object that follows the shape of a source location, but with all properties nulled out. With that, we get the desired result:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"553\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-04-30 at 10 50 30 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf55fd32-8375-4cfa-8202-49b45ef02931\" />\r\n\r\nI'm going to feature-flag this since setting some of these properties in this way might break in other versions of Babel or have other issues.\n\n[ghstack-poisoned]\n---\n[//]: # (BEGIN SAPLING FOOTER)\nStack created with [Sapling](https://sapling-scm.com).

Which makes sense because of how VMs work it can cause memory leaks. However, in our cases this doesn't matter and code size matters more. So we can't use many clever tricks.\r\n\r\nSo this just favors writing the source in the inline form. Then we add an extra compiler pass to turn those global variables into local variables in the external runtime.\r\n",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nThis PR migrates deep import from react-native to the root import. The motivation behind this is that the newly introduced package exports in react native are more strict, and this import breaks type resolution for `ReactNativePrivateInterface`.\r\n\r\nAfter adding `HostInstance`, `PublicTextInstance`, and `PublicRootInstance` to the `react-native` module, CIs failed due to different opaque types in `react-native` and `ReactNativePrivateInterface`. Moving their declarations to the global scope fixed the issue. It is not entirely possible to migrate `react-native-renderer` to root imports, as not all used identifiers are root exported in `react-native`.\r\n\r\nImported `react` types are changed to be used under the `React` namespace. This is required for Flow tooling to translate them into TypeScript equivalents correctly.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nSignals, react-native main\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n",

This is because there was no direct dependency relationship between the value being returned and the outer scope. The fix is to track the set of active scopes and make return values depend on all the active scopes at the point of the return.\r\n* For..of that reassigns a variable which later escapes were also not memoizing the collection. This is similar: the escape analysis aliasing didn't consider scopes that reassign, so there was no dependency between the returned variable and the scope that did the reassigning. The fix is to establish that dependency relationship.\r\n\r\nIn both cases, adding the additional scopes as a dependency of the right variable ensures that the scope's dependencies are treated as escaping (needing memoization), ensuring the collection is memoized.",

Specifically from https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/32950#issuecomment-2837887871, it sounds like Babel by default emits source map information for all nodes, even when they don't have a `loc` property set. Code coverage tools then pick up the synthesized source location information for this, leading to the issue described.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't super clear how to omit nodes from the source map. A few google searches didn't turn up any documented way to do so: the user can do so via a function supplied to babel, but plugins can't. Entire files can be opted out, but not nodes. I asked an LLM which answered that explicitly setting `node.loc = null` omits the node from source maps, but that didn't work. \r\n\r\nWhat did work was explicitly setting the `loc` property to an object that follows the shape of a source location, but with all properties nulled out. With that, we get the desired result:\r\n\r\n<img width=\"553\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-04-30 at 10 50 30 AM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf55fd32-8375-4cfa-8202-49b45ef02931\" />\r\n\r\nI'm going to feature-flag this since setting some of these properties in this way might break in other versions of Babel or have other issues.",

The lower score is better. \r\n\r\nThis table shows significant benchmark score improvements in `swap rows` and `create many rows`. While I understand that these two metrics are edge cases and are specifically designed to stress the implementation, I still wanted to present my findings because the code changes turned out to be relatively minor. My main goal was to get familiar with some of the codebase while doing a fun project, however, if there is interest I am happy to get this over the finish line.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"313\" alt=\"test-results\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/573eac8e-66f8-4f63-97f5-49e992dfa269\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n### Motivation\r\nI was looking at `reconcileChildrenArray` function in react-reconciler and found something that made me curious.\r\n\r\nSuppose we have a list of nodes:\r\n```\r\n[A, B, C, D, E, F, G]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat got re-arranged in the following way:\r\n```\r\n[A, F (moved), B, C, D, E, G]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally, only `F` should be marked as moved (Placement flag). However, the reconciler outputs this:\r\n```\r\n[A, F (moved), B (moved), C (moved), D (moved), E (moved), G]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly `A` and `G` remain in place. I found this interesting and dug further because I had an assumption that React would try to derive the least amount of dom operations needed. It seemed to me as if there was a code complexity tradeoff being made and I was curious if there was a way to make it granular while maintaining runtime performance.\r\n\r\nThis behavior comes from the `placeChild` helper:\r\n```ts\r\n  function placeChild(\r\n    newFiber: Fiber,\r\n    lastPlacedIndex: number,\r\n    newIndex: number,\r\n  ): number {\r\n     ...\r\n    const current = newFiber.alternate;\r\n    if (current !== null) {\r\n      const oldIndex = current.index;\r\n      if (oldIndex < lastPlacedIndex) {\r\n        // This is a move.\r\n        newFiber.flags |= Placement | PlacementDEV;\r\n        return lastPlacedIndex;\r\n      } else {\r\n        // This item can stay in place.\r\n        return oldIndex;\r\n      }\r\n     ...\r\n  }\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe above results in more work in `commitPlacement`, where for every \"placed\" node it will look up the closest \"non-placed\" stable sibling with dom (in `getHostSibling`) and insert each node before it. In our example for each \"placed\" node (F, B, C, D, E) React will traverse the fiber tree to lookup `G` repeatedly and call `insertBefore` to place it before `G`.\r\n\r\nThis is how this would look like in the browser when only one item is moved back:\r\n![browser](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a988e4de-92fa-4b8d-88d3-911946079721)\r\n\r\nThe fact that `getHostSibling` was constantly looking up stable host nodes and had to go past pending inserts also led me to consider that it could be cached to prevent potential deep traversals that result in the same output. \r\n\r\nFor example, if one was rendering a table and then populated the table rows, for each row in this table `getHostSibling` will be called and traverse the entire list of siblings in front but return `null` each time.\r\n\r\n### Proposed improvements\r\n\r\n**Granular placement of updated fiber nodes**\r\n\r\nIt's possible to derive the maximum number of updated nodes that can stay in place by looking at their indices in the old list and identifying which ones do not belong to the longest increasing subsequence when laid out in the new list order. An increasing subsequence of old indices in this case means those elements maintained their relative order.\r\n\r\nIf we look again at the previous example:\r\n```\r\n[A, B, C, D, E, F, G] -> [A, F (moved), B, C, D, E, G]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd take the old indices (alternate indices) of all updated nodes in the previous list:\r\n```\r\n[0 (A), 5 (F), 1 (B), 2 (C), 3 (D), 4 (E), 6 (G)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter we find the LIS it results in the following indices:\r\n```\r\n[0 (A), 1 (B), 2 (C), 3 (D), 4 (E), 6 (G)]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIndices not in LIS:\r\n```\r\n[5 (F)] - this node was moved\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can proceed to mark `F` with the Placement flag and all other updated nodes can remain in place.\r\n\r\n**Finding nodes not in LIS:**\r\n\r\nThe LIS is computed using a greedy patience sort, conceptually it can be visualized like this:\r\n<img width=\"438\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-04-19 at 6 47 09 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92ae2065-2387-4033-a90f-865146f6dbf5\" />\r\nSlide from [here](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring13/cos423/lectures/LongestIncreasingSubsequence.pdf).\r\n\r\nThe time complexity is `O(n)` in the case of all numbers increasing or decreasing (the most common cases) and O(N log N) in the case of completely random reordering of all nodes in the list.\r\n\r\nThe algorithm in this PR is modified to fit the exact use case of finding which entry is not in LIS.\r\n\r\n**Caching of `getHostSibling`**\r\n\r\nLet's say we have a list that originally did not have any rows and then rendered the following:\r\n```\r\n<List>\r\n  <Row key='A' value='A'>\r\n  <Row key='B' value='B'>\r\n  <Row key='C' value='C'>\r\n  <Row key='D' value='D'>\r\n  <Row key='E' value='E'>\r\n<List>\r\n```\r\nWhen committing row placement the current implementation will: \r\n- Look at `A` and start searching for the next sibling that `A` can be placed before\r\n- Eventually traverse the entire list resulting in `null` (all nodes are new).\r\n\r\nIf we maintain a cache per parent node (in this case `List`), we can keep track of the last node that was placed and what `stateNode` it was placed before. \r\n\r\nThen when processing `B` in `commitPlacement` we can:\r\n- Reference the cache by parent (`return`)\r\n- Find out that the last placed node was `A` and that it was placed before `null` (end of list). \r\n- We verify that `A` is our direct previous sibling, and skip doing the traversal because we know it would result in the same host sibling.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n1. Ran the existing test suite\r\n3. Ran the `js-framework-benchmark` on the modified version of React without issues\r\n4. Introduced a test to verify reordering still works as expected in both regular and iterator versions of `reconcileChildrenArray`\r\n5. Added a test for a helper that computes what is not in LIS\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n",

The pattern suggested in [1] is extremely underrated, but also unnecessarily confusing. React should offer and promote a less obscure hook-based solution to the problem so as to avoid the suggested solution's complexity and prevent developers from misemploying `useEffect`.\n\n## Motivation\n\nHere is the right way to reset state when some input changes, as suggested in [1]:\n\n```typescript\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);\nconst [prevInitialCount, setPrevInitialCount] = useState(initialCount);\n\nif (initialCount !== prevInitialCount) {\n  setPrevInitialCount(initialCount);\n  setCount(initialCount);\n}\n```\n\nThe input in question (`initialCount` in this case) could be a prop, a context value, an input argument to a custom hook, or some value derived from a combination of those.\n\nFrom my experience, however, most people are either unaware of this pattern or find it too confusing to wrap their heads around, and therefore use an effect-based approach instead:\n\n```typescript\nconst [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);\n\nuseEffect(() => {\n  setCount(initialCount);\n}, [initialCount]);\n```\n\nThe prevalence of this approach is hard to overstate. Using an effect is suggested in top answers to pretty much all questions about syncing state to props on StackOverflow ([example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54865764/react-usestate-does-not-reload-state-from-props), [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54625831/how-to-sync-props-to-state-using-react-hooks-setstate), [example](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68730502/react-usestate-with-state-that-updates-based-on-props)). All AI assistants I've asked also suggested this as their recommended solution. But most importantly, this is the approach I see used in the wild all the time, even by devs much more experienced than I am.\n\nThe problem with the approach is that effects only run after rendering is completed and, in most cases, after its results are committed to the DOM. This results in unnecessary rerenders and inconsistent intermediate states being displayed in the UI.\n\nUnnecessary rerenders are also a drawback of the approach suggested in [1] as I will show in a moment.\n\nLet's explore the drawbacks of both approaches with a more advanced example I've come up with.\n\n```typescript\nimport {\n  createContext,\n  useContext,\n  useEffect,\n  useMemo,\n  useReducer,\n  useState,\n} from \"react\";\nimport { createRoot } from \"react-dom/client\";\n\nconst ClientLanguageContext = createContext(\"en\"); // English is the default\n\nfunction useClientLanguage() {\n  return useContext(ClientLanguageContext);\n}\n\nfunction LanguageCheckboxes({\n  additionalLanguages,\n}: {\n  additionalLanguages: string[];\n}) {\n  const clientLanguage = useClientLanguage();\n\n  const languages = useMemo(\n    () => new Set([clientLanguage, ...additionalLanguages]),\n    [clientLanguage, additionalLanguages]\n  );\n\n  const [checkedLanguages, setCheckedLanguages] = useState(new Set<string>());\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    setCheckedLanguages((prev) => {    \n      // If the `languages` set has changed in a way that it no longer includes\n      // some of the languages it included before, those removed languages also\n      // have to be removed from `checkedLanguages`!\n\n      // Compute the intersection of `languages` and previous `checkedLanguages`:\n      const next = new Set(\n        Array.from(prev).filter((language) => languages.has(language))\n      );\n\n      // Only actually adjust the value if languages have been removed:\n      return next.size < prev.size ? next : prev;\n    });\n  }, [languages]);\n\n  return (\n    <>\n      {Array.from(languages).map((language) => (\n        <div key={language}>\n          <label>\n            <input\n              value={language}\n              type=\"checkbox\"\n              checked={checkedLanguages.has(language)}\n              onChange={(e) => {\n                const nextCheckedLanguages = new Set(checkedLanguages);\n                if (e.target.checked) nextCheckedLanguages.add(language);\n                else nextCheckedLanguages.delete(language);\n                setCheckedLanguages(nextCheckedLanguages);\n              }}\n            />\n            {language}\n          </label>\n        </div>\n      ))}\n      <p>Checked languages: {Array.from(checkedLanguages).join(\", \")}</p>\n    </>\n  );\n}\n\nconst ADDITIONAL_LANGUAGES = [\"de\", \"fr\"];\n\nfunction App() {\n  const [clientLanguage, setClientLanguage] = useState(\"en\");\n  const [additionalLanguages, toggleAdditionalLanguages] = useReducer(\n    (prev) => (prev.length ? [] : ADDITIONAL_LANGUAGES),\n    ADDITIONAL_LANGUAGES\n  );\n\n  return (\n    <ClientLanguageContext value={clientLanguage}>\n      <p>\n        Client language:\n        <br />\n        <input\n          value={clientLanguage}\n          onChange={(e) => setClientLanguage(e.target.value)}\n        />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        <button onClick={toggleAdditionalLanguages}>\n          Toggle additional languages\n        </button>\n      </p>\n      <LanguageCheckboxes additionalLanguages={additionalLanguages} />\n    </ClientLanguageContext>\n  );\n}\n\ncreateRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\")!).render(<App />);\n```\n\nThis example app does not offer any useful functionality, but it is good at demonstrating all sorts of issues related to derived state.\n\nAs you can see, I've chosen the wrong `useEffect` approach for this initial implementation. If you check all available languages and then click the toggle button, you will notice that “de” and “fr” disappear faster from the checkboxes than from the “Checked languages” list on the bottom, where they stay a few milliseconds longer. The reason is that the effect adjusting `checkedLanguages` is only executed after the render caused by the `additionalLanguages` update is completed and its result is reflected in the UI. This is simply how effects work in React, and the fact that we get to see an invalid state in the UI because of that is what makes the `useEffect` approach to derived state an absolute no-go. \n\nLet's now try the approach suggested in [1]:\n\n```typescript\nfunction LanguageCheckboxes({\n  additionalLanguages,\n}: {\n  additionalLanguages: string[];\n}) {\n  const clientLanguage = useClientLanguage();\n\n  const languages = useMemo(\n    () => new Set([clientLanguage, ...additionalLanguages]),\n    [clientLanguage, additionalLanguages]\n  );\n\n  const [checkedLanguages, setCheckedLanguages] = useState(new Set<string>());\n\n  const [prevLanguages, setPrevLanguages] = useState(languages);\n  if (languages !== prevLanguages) {\n    setPrevLanguages(languages);\n\n    // If the `languages` set has changed in a way that it no longer includes\n    // some of the languages it included before, those removed languages also\n    // have to be removed from `checkedLanguages`!\n\n    // Compute the intersection of `languages` and `checkedLanguages`:\n    const nextCheckedLanguages = new Set(\n      Array.from(checkedLanguages).filter((language) => languages.has(language))\n    );\n\n    // Only adjust `checkedLanguages` if languages have been removed:\n    if (nextCheckedLanguages.size < checkedLanguages.size) {\n      setCheckedLanguages(nextCheckedLanguages);\n    }\n  }\n\n  return /* ... */;\n}\n```\n\nWell, this does seem to work, but unfortunately, it is not a good solution either. The reason is that the value of `languages` is computed with the `useMemo` hook, which, according to [the docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/useMemo), should only be used as a performance optimization. The code we write should work perfectly fine without it, but that is not the case here: since without `useMemo`, the identity of `languages` would change on every render, `setPrevLanguages(languages)` would end up being called in an infinite loop!\n\nTo overcome this complication, we have to store previous values of both inputs the `languages` variable is derived from (i.e. `clientLanguage` and `additionalLanguages`) instead of its own previous values:\n\n```typescript\nfunction LanguageCheckboxes({\n  additionalLanguages,\n}: {\n  additionalLanguages: string[];\n}) {\n  const clientLanguage = useClientLanguage();\n\n  const languages = useMemo(\n    () => new Set([clientLanguage, ...additionalLanguages]),\n    [clientLanguage, additionalLanguages]\n  );\n\n  const [checkedLanguages, setCheckedLanguages] = useState(new Set<string>());\n\n  const [prevClientLanguage, setPrevClientLanguage] = useState(clientLanguage);\n  const [prevAdditionalLanguages, setPrevAdditionalLanguages] =\n    useState(additionalLanguages);\n\n  if (\n    clientLanguage !== prevClientLanguage ||\n    additionalLanguages !== prevAdditionalLanguages\n  ) {\n    setPrevClientLanguage(clientLanguage);\n    setPrevAdditionalLanguages(additionalLanguages);\n\n    // If the `languages` set has changed in a way that it no longer includes\n    // some of the languages it included before, those removed languages also\n    // have to be removed from `checkedLanguages`!\n\n    // Compute the intersection of `languages` and `checkedLanguages`:\n    const nextCheckedLanguages = new Set(\n      Array.from(checkedLanguages).filter((language) => languages.has(language))\n    );\n\n    // Only adjust `checkedLanguages` if languages have been removed:\n    if (nextCheckedLanguages.size < checkedLanguages.size) {\n      setCheckedLanguages(nextCheckedLanguages);\n    }\n  }\n\n  return /* ... */;\n}\n```\n\nThis is the correct code that I think adheres to all React's official recommendations, but oh boy, is it cumbersome, fragile and confusing! Imagine deciding to extend `languages` by elements from yet another source beside `clientLanguage` and `additionalLanguages`. How easy is it to forget to add a `prevX` state variable for this new source? The linter is not there to remind us!\n\nFurthermore, we haven't got rid of the unnecessary rerendering. The inconsistent result of the first render doesn't end up in the UI anymore and instead gets immediately thrown away as explained in [1], but still, that unnecessary first render does take place! Can we really not do better than that?\n\nOne idea that often comes to mind in the context of state synchronization is to use a different value for the `key` attribute whenever some input that the component's state is derived from changes. This is the recommended approach in [2], but unfortunately, it barely solves anything. There is a bunch of problems with the approach:\n\n- It is useless in the context of custom hooks since there are no components involved in their definitions, and so we cannot really supply the key anywhere.\n- Changing the key causes *all* of the component's internal state to be reset, which is rarely what we want.\n- Changing the key causes a new DOM subtree to be created for the component. Besides being quite inefficient, this can also cause unwanted side effects such as the focused input within the component not being focused anymore after the remount.\n- If the component's state is derived from more than one input values, the developer has to come up with a clever way to combine those values into a key.\n\nI hope this is enough to show how bad this key solution is in most cases.\n\nLet's now have a look at the alternative I suggest.\n\n## Proposal: Extend `useState` by a dependency array\n\nThe alternative isn't new, it has been suggested before a couple of times. I particularly like this definition from #14738:\n\n> It would be useful if we could declare dependencies for `useState`, in the same way that we can for `useMemo`, and have the state reset back to the initial state if they change:\n>\n> ```javascript\n> const [choice, setChoice] = useState(options[0], [options]);\n> ```\n>\n> In order to allow preserving the current value if it's valid, React could supply `prevState` to the initial state factory function, if any exists, e.g.\n>\n> ```javascript\n> const [choice, setChoice] = useState(prevState => {\n>   if (prevState && options.includes(prevState) {\n>     return prevState;\n>  else {\n>     return options[0];\n>  }\n> }, [options]);\n> ```\n\nThis is a very natural solution requiring pretty much no mind shift at all since it simply brings `useState` in line with the other hooks accepting a dependency array – a concept well-known to all React developers.\n\nThe example with `LanguageCheckboxes` has demonstrated that in certain scenarios, adjusting state based on both the new input and the previous state value is needed. That is why the `prevState` part of the proposal is especially important. This is how `LanguageCheckboxes` could be simplified with it:\n\n```typescript\nfunction LanguageCheckboxes({\n  additionalLanguages,\n}: {\n  additionalLanguages: string[];\n}) {\n  const clientLanguage = useClientLanguage();\n\n  const languages = useMemo(\n    () => new Set([clientLanguage, ...additionalLanguages]),\n    [clientLanguage, additionalLanguages]\n  );\n\n  const [checkedLanguages, setCheckedLanguages] = useState<Set<string>>(\n    (prev) => {\n      if (prev === undefined) return new Set();\n\n      // If the `languages` set has changed in a way that it no longer includes\n      // some of the languages it included before, those removed languages also\n      // have to be removed from `checkedLanguages`!\n\n      // Compute the intersection of `languages` and previous `checkedLanguages`:\n      const next = new Set(\n        Array.from(prev).filter((language) => languages.has(language))\n      );\n\n      // Only actually adjust the value if languages have been removed:\n      return next.size < prev.size ? next : prev;\n    },\n    [languages]\n  );\n\n  return /* ... */;\n}\n```\n\nThis is very similar to the original `useEffect` solution people love for its readability, but without any of its drawbacks! Isn't that beautiful?\n\nBy the way, a user-land implementation of this proposal exists, see [`use-state-with-deps`](https://github.com/peterjuras/use-state-with-deps).\n\n## More motivating examples\n\nThe proposal has been [rejected](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14738#issuecomment-461868904) before with the following argumentation:\n\n> The idiomatic way to reset state based on props is here:\n> \n> https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-do-i-implement-getderivedstatefromprops\n> \n> In other words:\n> \n> ```typescript\n> const [selectedChoice, setSelectedChoice] = useState(options[0]);\n> const [prevOptions, setPrevOptions] = useState(options);\n> \n> if (options !== prevOptions) {\n>   setPrevOptions(options);\n>   setSelectedChoice(options[0]);\n> }\n> ```\n> \n> I don't think we want to encourage this pattern commonly so we're avoiding adding a shorter way (although we considered your suggestion).\n\nIn general, I feel like the React team is trying to make me believe that adjusting state when some input value changes is not something I want to do. I cannot agree with that. Here are 2 examples of real-world scenarios where derived state makes perfect sense that I have encountered just recently:\n\n1. `useRelativeTime`: a hook that returns the relative time string like “in 5 seconds” or “2 minutes ago” that it keeps up-to-date, for a given timestamp, in a given language. The current output value is kept in a state variable that may need to be adjusted when the input timestamp or language changes.\n\n    <details>\n    <summary>Click to show code</summary>\n\n    ```typescript\n    import { useEffect, useMemo, useRef, useState } from \"react\";\n    import { createRoot } from \"react-dom/client\";\n\n    const units: { name: Intl.RelativeTimeFormatUnit; milliseconds: number }[] = [\n      { name: \"week\", milliseconds: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 },\n      { name: \"day\", milliseconds: 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 },\n      { name: \"hour\", milliseconds: 1000 * 60 * 60 },\n      { name: \"minute\", milliseconds: 1000 * 60 },\n      { name: \"second\", milliseconds: 1000 },\n    ];\n\n    function relativeTimeHelper(\n      timeInMs: number,\n      rtf: Intl.RelativeTimeFormat\n    ): readonly [output: string, nextBumpTime: number] {\n      const now = Date.now();\n      const diff = timeInMs - now;\n      const absDiff = Math.abs(diff);\n\n      const settleForUnit = (unit: (typeof units)[0]) => {\n        const value = Math.trunc(diff / unit.milliseconds);\n        const output = rtf.format(value, unit.name);\n        const nextBumpTime =\n          diff > 0 // time in the future\n            ? now + (diff % unit.milliseconds) + 1\n            : timeInMs + (-value + 1) * unit.milliseconds;\n        return [output, nextBumpTime] as const;\n      };\n\n      for (const unit of units) {\n        if (absDiff > unit.milliseconds) {\n          return settleForUnit(unit);\n        }\n      }\n\n      return settleForUnit(units[units.length - 1]);\n    }\n\n    function useRelativeTime(language: string, timeInMs?: number) {\n      const rtf = useMemo(() => new Intl.RelativeTimeFormat(language), [language]);\n\n      const [initialOutput, initialNextBumpTime] = useMemo(() => {\n        return timeInMs !== undefined ? relativeTimeHelper(timeInMs, rtf) : [];\n      }, [timeInMs, rtf]);\n\n      // Does this part have to be so confusing? This would be so much cleaner:\n      // const [output, setOutput] = useState(initialOutput, [initialOutput]);\n      const [output, setOutput] = useState(initialOutput);\n      const [prevInitialOutput, setPrevInitialOutput] = useState(initialOutput);\n      if (initialOutput !== prevInitialOutput) {\n        setPrevInitialOutput(initialOutput);\n        setOutput(initialOutput);\n      }\n\n      useEffect(() => {\n        if (timeInMs !== undefined) {\n          const bump = () => {\n            const [nextOutput, nextBumpTime] = relativeTimeHelper(timeInMs, rtf);\n            setOutput(nextOutput);\n            timeout = setTimeout(bump, nextBumpTime - Date.now());\n          };\n\n          let timeout = setTimeout(bump, initialNextBumpTime! - Date.now());\n          return () => clearTimeout(timeout);\n        }\n      }, [timeInMs, rtf, initialNextBumpTime]);\n\n      return output;\n    }\n\n    function App() {\n      const time = useRef(Date.now() + 5000);\n      const output = useRelativeTime(\"en\", time.current);\n      return output;\n    }\n\n    createRoot(document.getElementById(\"root\")!).render(<App />);\n    ```\n    </details>\n2. A component displaying hierarchical data from a tree structure. The components's toolbar includes an input that can be used to control the depth up to which the nodes' children are to be expanded. The data changes dynamically, so it can happen that a previously valid input value becomes invalid because it starts exceeding the overall (maximum) depth of the tree that has decreased. In that case, the input value has to be adjusted to match the new maximum depth.\n\nSure, adjusting state based on input changes is not something you do every day, but nonetheless, scenarios where this is necessary are manifold. I feel like by “avoiding adding a shorter way” so as not “to encourage this pattern”, React does more harm than good:\n\n- The developers who don't know about the `prevState` pattern or don't understand it, those who find it too confusing or fail to see its advantages over the `usEffect` approach, as well as those who don't understand how effects work well enough, end up resorting to `useEffect` and introducing inconsistencies that I've illustrated above. This happens so often that I wouldn't be surprised if even Meta's own codebases included examples of this. I am sure that providing a clear API like the suggested enhanced `useState` hook would help reduce the frequency of such misuses of `useEffect`.\n- The developers who do understand the `prevState` pattern and when to use it end up having to suffer from its deliberate clumsiness or rely on user-land solutions like the aforementioned `use-state-with-deps` library (which, by the way, was not exactly easy to find).\n\nThis is why I think the proposal should be reconsidered. If I haven't missed anything, it's been more than 5 years since the proposal was last brought up in this repository. The React landscape was very different back then, as the transition from class components to hooks was still ongoing. Maybe it wasn't entirely clear 5 years ago how often the `useEffect` hook would be misused. Also I suppose that developers would resort to class components whenever they wanted to avoid confusing patterns of the new and daunting hook world. This doesn't happen anymore. Taking all of that into consideration, I think the time has come to give the proposal a second look!\n",
