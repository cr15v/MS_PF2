    "body": "## Bug Report: Excessive Re-renders in Component Despite Multiple Optimizations\n\n**Description**\n\nA specific component in our Next.js application exhibits a high number of re-renders (approx. 8-10) even *after* all asynchronous data fetching (from APIs and Context) is complete and related loading states are false. This occurs despite applying various standard React optimization techniques, including memoizing context providers, functions, and derived state.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce**\n\nUnfortunately, isolating this issue into a minimal reproducible example has proven difficult due to the component's reliance on multiple contexts and asynchronous operations within our specific application structure. However, the core setup involves:\n\n1.  A dynamic route page component (e.g., `/app/items/[itemId]/details/[detailId]`).\n2.  The component uses `useEffect` to fetch data from two separate API endpoints based on route parameters (`itemId`, `detailId`) upon mount and when parameters change.\n3.  The component consumes data from two separate contexts (`AuthContext`, `FeatureFlagContext`) using `useContext`.\n4.  The component manages multiple states using `useState` for the fetched data, loading status, and error status for both API calls.\n5.  Data fetching functions are wrapped in `useCallback`.\n6.  Context providers for `AuthContext` and `FeatureFlagContext` have their `value` prop memoized using `useMemo`.\n7.  Derived state values (e.g., `isPageLoading`) are memoized using `useMemo`.\n8.  All major functions within the component are memoized using `useCallback`.\n9.  An attempt was made to consolidate multiple loading/error states into a single state object, which did not resolve the issue and potentially increased renders.\n10. React Strict Mode is confirmed to be **disabled**.\n\n**Expected Behavior**\n\nAfter the initial loading phase and subsequent state updates settle (i.e., all loading states are `false`, data is populated), the component should render only once or twice more at most, ideally stabilizing without further renders until user interaction or prop changes occur.\n\n**Actual Behavior**\n\nConsole logs show the component rendering approximately 8-10 times *after* all loading states (`bolumLoading`, `previewsLoading`, `limitLoading`) are `false`. This suggests that the sequence or batching of state updates within the asynchronous data fetching functions (`fetchItemData`, `fetchDetailData`) might be triggering an unexpected cascade of renders, even though the final state values are stable. The number of renders sometimes appeared to *increase* after applying `useCallback` to more functions or attempting state collocation.\n\n**Environment**\n\n*   **React:** `^18`\n*   **Next.js:** `^15.3.1`\n*   **Node.js:** [22.14.0]\n*   **OS:** Linux (Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS)\n*   **Browser:** [1.77.97 Chromium: 135.0.7049.84 ]\n\n**Additional Context**\n\nWe have applied standard optimization techniques (`useMemo` for contexts/derived state, `useCallback` for functions) as documented. The persistence of these extra renders after stabilization is unexpected and difficult to debug further without deeper insight into React's internal scheduling or potential interactions between multiple asynchronous state updates within `useEffect`.\n\n",

It is custom code that implements anchor-like positioning in JS, so somewhat messy code with refs, layout effects, and calculating the size and position of DOM elements. Suddenly one on the popups ended up positioned at `(0, 0)` with the compiler active, and adding `\"use no memo\"` in the affected component made the issue go away.\n\nThe repro here is a simplified version, which still behaves differently with and without the compiler. I am not aware of breaking any rules of React, but it is very possible I’m hitting some undefined behavior in the order in which effects run or similar.\n\nI couldn’t simplify it much further, in particular\n- removing `useHover` to always return `true` makes the issue go away,\n- replacing the `refContainer` by the ref itself makes the issue go away,\n- removing `hoverRef` makes the issue go away.\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n19.1.0\n\n### What version of React Compiler are you using?\n\n19.1.0-rc.1",

This behavior appears to be applied universally, regardless of whether the hook is a built-in (native) React hook or a custom one.\n\nHowever, for most native hooks, this memoization is unnecessary. It results in increased output code size and adds runtime overhead without any meaningful benefit.\n\n## Examples\n\nInput code using `useRef`:\n```js\nconst ref = useRef({ value });\n``` \nCompiled output:\n```js\n  let t1;\n  if ($[0] !== value) {\n    t1 = { value };\n    $[0] = value;\n    $[1] = t1;\n  } else {\n    t1 = $[1];\n  }\n  const ref = useRef(t1);\n```\n\nInput code using `useState`:\n```js\nconst [state, setState] = useState({ value });\n``` \nCompiled output:\n```js\n  let t2;\n  if ($[2] !== value) {\n    t2 = { value };\n    $[2] = value;\n    $[3] = t2;\n  } else {\n    t2 = $[3];\n  }\n  const [state, setState] = useState(t2);\n```\n\nIn both examples, the memoization of the initial values passed to the native hooks is unnecessary.\n\nThis same pattern of memoization is also applied to other built-in hooks such as `useReducer` and `useEffect`\n\n## Expected behavior\nThe compiler should treat native hooks differently and avoid memoizing parameters when it's not needed. This would reduce both the generated code size and runtime overhead.\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n19.1.0\n\n### What version of React Compiler are you using?\n\n19.1.0-rc.1",

However, sync Server Components and just plain Host Components are not. Plus we should ideally ideally inline more of the async ones in the same way Fizz does.\r\n\r\nThis means that we can create rows that end up very large. Especially if all the data is already available. We can't show the parent content until the whole thing loads on the client.\r\n\r\nWe don't really know where Suspense boundaries are for Flight but any Element is potentially a point that can be split.\r\n\r\nThis heuristic counts roughly how much we've serialized to block the current chunk and once a limit is exceeded, we start deferring all Elements. That way they get outlined into future chunks that are later in the stream. Since they get replaced by Lazy references the parent can potentially get unblocked.\r\n\r\nThis can help if you're trying to stream a very large document with a client nav for example.",

Starting from the size of the root (minus preamble) for the shell.\r\n\r\nThis ensures that if you have many small boundaries they don't all continue to get inlined. For example, you can wrap each paragraph in a document in a Suspense boundary to regain document streaming capabilities if that's what you want.\r\n\r\nHowever, one consideration is if it's worth producing a fallback at all. Maybe if it's like `null` it's free but if it's like a whole alternative page, then it's not. It's possible to have completely useless Suspense boundaries such as when you nest several directly inside each other. So this uses a limit of at least 500 bytes of the content itself for it to be worth outlining at all. It also can't be too small because then for example a long list of paragraphs can never be outlined.\r\n\r\nIn the fixture I straddle this limit so some paragraphs are too small to be considered. An unfortunate effect of that is that you can end up with some of them not being outlined which means that they appear out of order. SuspenseList is supposed to address that but it's unfortunate.\r\n\r\nThe limit is still fairly high though so it's unlikely that by default you'd start outlining anything within the viewport at all. I had to reduce the `progressiveChunkSize` by an order of magnitude in my fixture to try it out properly.",

This starts counting the bytes by taking a pass over the added chunks each time a segment completes.\r\n\r\nThat allows us to outline a Suspense boundary to stream in late even if it is already loaded by the time that back-pressure flow and in a `prerender`. Meaning it gets inserted with script.\r\n\r\nThe effect can be seen in the fixture where if you have large HTML content that can block initial paint (thanks to [`rel=\"expect\"`](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/33016) but also nested Suspense boundaries). Before this fix, the paint would be blocked until the large content loaded. This lets us paint the fallback first in the case that the raw bytes of the content takes a while to download.\r\n\r\nYou can set it to `Infinity` to opt-out. E.g. if you want to ensure there's never any scripts. It's always set to `Infinity` in `renderToHTML` and the legacy `renderToString`.\r\n\r\nOne downside is that if we might choose to outline a boundary, we need to let its fallback complete.\r\n\r\nWe don't currently discount the size of the fallback but really just consider them additive even though in theory the fallback itself could also add significant size or even more than the content. It should maybe really be considered the delta but that would require us to track the size of the fallback separately which is tricky.\r\n\r\nOne problem with the current heuristic is that we just consider the size of the boundary content itself down to the next boundary. If you have a lot of small boundaries adding up, it'll never kick in. I intend to address that in a follow up.",

    "body": "See https://github.com/rollup/plugins/issues/1425\r\n\r\nCurrently, `@babel/helper-string-parser/lib/index.js` is either emitted as a wrapped esmodule or inline depending on the ordering of async functions in `rollup/commonjs`. Specifically, `@babel/types/lib/definitions/core.js` is cyclic (i.e. transitively depends upon itself), but sometimes `@babel/helper-string-parser/lib/index.js` is emitted before this is realized.\r\n\r\n\r\nA relatively straightforward patch is to wrap all modules (see https://github.com/rollup/plugins/issues/1425#issuecomment-1465626736). This only regresses `eslint-plugin-react-hooks` bundle size by ~1.8% and is safer (see https://github.com/rollup/plugins/blob/master/packages/commonjs/README.md#strictrequires)\r\n\r\n> The default value of true will wrap all CommonJS files in functions which are executed when they are required for the first time, preserving NodeJS semantics. This is the safest setting and should be used if the generated code does not work correctly with \"auto\". Note that strictRequires: true can have a small impact on the size and performance of generated code, but less so if the code is minified.\r\n\r\n(note that we're on an earlier version of `@rollup/commonjs` which does not default to `strictRequires: true`)\r\n",

We are now seeing issues for components using one of the Icons when also a state is updated within a `useEffect()`.\nWhile updating from React 18.3.1 to React 19.1.0 a few of our tests are running forever (infinite loop?).\nWe were able to narrow it down to the React upgrade and created a minimal test case for this.\n\n### Related Issues\n#29930: [React 19] infinite loop when using React lazy & functional formAction together\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Open [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/great-visvesvaraya-fvk7sq?)\n2. Download the code\n3. Run `yarn install`\n4. Run `yarn test:only-hanging`\n5. Will load forever\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7a32aea-f753-473e-8359-144ee5c85827)\n\nCases where the bug does **not** happen:\n- Using React 18.3.1 instead of 19\n- When rendering less than 3 Icons\n- When running all tests (so having a working test-case right before) `yarn test:all`\n- Doing **no** state update from the useEffect\n",

    "body": "The semantics of React is that anything outside of Suspense boundaries in a transition doesn't display until it has fully unsuspended. With SSR streaming the intention is to preserve that.\r\n\r\nWe explicitly don't want to support the mode of document streaming normally supported by the browser where it can paint content as tags stream in since that leads to content popping in and thrashing in unpredictable ways. This should instead be modeled explictly by nested Suspense boundaries or something like SuspenseList.\r\n\r\nAfter the first shell any nested Suspense boundaries are only revealed, by script, once they're fully streamed in to the next boundary. So this is already the case there. However, for the initial shell we have been at the mercy of browser heuristics for how long it decides to stream before the first paint.\r\n\r\nChromium now has [an API explicitly for this use case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API/Using#stabilizing_page_state_to_make_cross-document_transitions_consistent) that lets us model the semantics that we want. This is always important but especially so with MPA View Transitions.\r\n\r\nAfter this a simple document looks like this:\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<!DOCTYPE html>\r\n<html>\r\n  <head>\r\n     <link rel=\"expect\" href=\"#«R»\" blocking=\"render\"/>\r\n  </head>\r\n  <body>\r\n    <p>hello world</p>\r\n    <script src=\"bootstrap.js\" id=\"«R»\" async=\"\"></script>\r\n    ...\r\n  </body>\r\n</html>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `rel=\"expect\"` tag indicates that we want to wait to paint until we have streamed far enough to be able to paint the id `\"«R»\"` which indicates the shell.\r\n\r\nIdeally this `id` would be assigned to the root most HTML element in the body. However, this is tricky in our implementation because there can be multiple and we can render them out of order.\r\n\r\nSo instead, we assign the id to the first bootstrap script if there is one since these are always added to the end of the shell. If there isn't a bootstrap script then we emit an empty `<template id=\"«R»\"></template>` instead as a marker.\r\n\r\nSince we currently put as much as possible in the shell if it's loaded by the time we render, this can have some negative effects for very large documents. We should instead apply the heuristic where very large Suspense boundaries get outlined outside the shell even if they're immediately available. This means that even prerenders can end up with script tags.\r\n\r\nWe only emit the `rel=\"expect\"` if you're rendering a whole document. I.e. if you rendered either a `<html>` or `<head>` tag. If you're rendering a partial document, then we don't really know where the streaming parts are anyway and can't provide such guarantees. This does apply whether you're streaming or not because we still want to block rendering until the end, but in practice any serialized state that needs hydrate should still be embedded after the completion id.",

Notice that a menu is opened, but a tooltip does not exist 🚨\n\nLink to code example: https://stackblitz.com/edit/vitejs-vite-nnvwzvcm\n\n## The current behavior\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2680b226-c08e-4015-bc24-1393b1206c7e\n\n```\nMenu:useEffect() // moves focus to MenuItem ✅ \nMenuItem:onFocus() => Tooltip:onFocus() // triggers a setTimeout() to open Tooltip ✅ \nTooltip:useEffect:dispose() // calls clearTimeout() 🚨\n```\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nWithout `StrictMode` a dispose function is not called:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88f74eb1-3522-464e-9d4e-017301322593\n\n---\n\nThat's a simplified version of the issue from https://github.com/microsoft/fluentui/issues/34296. I **clearly** understand that it's not a bug in React. It does what's expected 👍\n\nThe correct approach is to fire `setTimeout()` & `clearTimeout()` in `useEffect()`. The problem is that the described pattern is not unique and adopted by component libraries:\n- https://github.com/mui/material-ui/blob/ad81de06c384d446d4fc9740a53b692f209165a3/packages/mui-material/src/Tooltip/Tooltip.js#L410-L413\n- https://github.com/radix-ui/primitives/blob/e2e0559010cb5e861944ecba840823ae530fa4a8/packages/react/tooltip/src/tooltip.tsx#L205C9-L221\n- more...\n\nSo we are wondering what is a proper solution in case and looking for guidance in this particular case 🙏 ",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\n-->\n\nReact version: 19.0.0\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Clone this repo: https://github.com/yesquesasi/webpack-5-react-boilerplate \n2. Checkout to branch `react-profiler-test`\n3. Install dependencies: `yarn install` \n4. Create a production build: `yarn build`\n5. Run the application: `yarn prod`\n6. Open page in browser: http://localhost:8005/\n7. Open browser console, an error appears: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'd')`\n\n\nI've forked the repo [webpack-5-react-boilerplate](https://github.com/persteenolsen/webpack-5-react-boilerplate), which is a perfectly working React 19 + Webpack repository, adding [the code the React.Profiler documentation](https://gist.github.com/bvaughn/25e6233aeb1b4f0cdb8d8366e54a3977) points out to to enable `React.Profiler` in production, you can see that code in [this PR](https://github.com/yesquesasi/webpack-5-react-boilerplate/pull/1/files) - with this you can reproduce the error that I'm seeing in another larger application.\n\n## The current behavior\n\nI have a larger application using `React.Profiler` in production, I followed the [steps to enable](https://gist.github.com/bvaughn/25e6233aeb1b4f0cdb8d8366e54a3977) it and everything was working as expected, I was using `react@18.3.1` and `react-dom@18.3.1`\n\nAfter upgrading to `react@19.0.0` (and even 19.1.0) I started seeing that `React.Profiler` no longer worked in the production build (it does work in development tho) having a very similar runtime error to the one above when I opened any page: `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'd')`, since it's the production build everything is minified and I haven't had luck finding more details about the error.\n\n## Research made\n\nI compared the code inside `node_modules` for `react-dom@18.3.1` and `react-dom@19.0.0` to see if I was able to find any ways to fix it, but had no luck. The main difference between those 2 versions are:\n\n### The exported configuration in `package.json`\n\nWe have this for `react-dom@18.3.1` in [package.json](https://github.com/yesquesasi/webpack-5-react-boilerplate/blob/react-dom18-node-module/node_modules/react-dom/package.json)\n\n```\n....\n  \"exports\": {\n    \".\": \"./index.js\",\n    \"./profiling\": \"./profiling.js\", \n    ....\n```\n\nwhereas in `react-dom@19.0.0`  in [package.json](https://github.com/yesquesasi/webpack-5-react-boilerplate/blob/react-dom19-node-module/node_modules/react-dom/package.json) the `exports` values are quite different using `default`:\n\n```\n...\n\"exports\": {\n    \".\": {\n      \"react-server\": \"./react-dom.react-server.js\",\n      \"default\": \"./index.js\"\n    },\n    \"./profiling\": {\n      \"react-server\": \"./profiling.react-server.js\",\n      \"default\": \"./profiling.js\"\n    },\n....\n```\n\nI thought this meant I needed to change the way I create the `alias` in my webpack config, but I tried several different ways and nothing worked while building\n\n```\n'react-dom$': 'react-dom/profiling' // original code from documentation (causing bug)\n\n'react-dom$': 'react-dom/profiling/default' // fails to build\n'react-dom$': 'react-dom/profiling.default' // fails to build\n'react-dom$': 'react-dom/profiling/profiling.js' // fails to build\n\n```\n\n### Contents of `profiling.js`\n\nLooking again at the differences in versions in `node_modules` I found that the file that ends up being export by `react-dom/profiler.js` changed from versions, the one in `react-dom@18.3.1` was minified whereas the one in `react-dom@19.0.0` is not precisely minified.\n\nI had no further findings in this area but I've updated the node modules to a repo for easier comparision:\n\n[react-dom@19.0.0 - profiling.js](https://github.com/yesquesasi/webpack-5-react-boilerplate/blob/react-dom19-node-module/node_modules/react-dom/profiling.js)\n[react-dom@19.0.0 - cjs/react-dom-profiling.profiling.js](https://github.com/yesquesasi/webpack-5-react-boilerplate/blob/react-dom19-node-module/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-profiling.profiling.js)\n\nVS\n\n[react-dom@18.3.1 - profiling.js](https://github.com/yesquesasi/webpack-5-react-boilerplate/blob/react-dom18-node-module/node_modules/react-dom/profiling.js)\n[react-dom@18.3.1 - cjs/react-dom.profiling.min.js](https://github.com/yesquesasi/webpack-5-react-boilerplate/blob/react-dom18-node-module/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom.profiling.min.js)\n\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nI'd appreciate your help to find out why this is not working and how to fix it.\n",

This fix patches InferReactivePlaces instead of adding a new pass since we want non-reactivity propagated correctly\n",

I call this less than ideal, considering I do not need the react-compiler related functionality.\n\nHaving the two plugins as separate makes sense to me, as the compiler is optional.\n\nI wonder, did you consider this when merging the two packages? Should I just fork eslint-plugin-react-hooks, as I only use `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks` and `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`?\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nRef: https://github.com/wixplosives/sample-monorepo/commit/e79349b17829385bc0f688ca9e98098fa1bd48ee",

Call `effect.use(handler)` ([docs](https://effector.dev/en/api/effector/effect/#methods-use-handler)) outside of a React component function.\n3. ESLint throws an error, treating `use` as a React Hook used outside a component body.\n\n## The current behavior\n\nThe ESLint rule incorrectly flags the use of `effect.use()` (from the Effector library) as an invalid hook usage. This happens because the plugin treats any identifier named `use` as a hook, even if it’s unrelated to React. In Effector, `use` is a valid method for assigning effect handlers and is often used outside component bodies.\n\nMoreover, there is currently no way to configure the rule to ignore specific names like `use`. Even though React now ships with a `use` hook, being able to exclude it from the rule check would be helpful in projects that also rely on libraries like Effector.\n\nAs a workaround, I had to patch the plugin manually using `yarn patch`. I changed the `isHookName` function as follows:\n\n**Original:**\n```ts\nfunction isHookName(s: string): boolean {\n  return s === 'use' || /^use[A-Z0-9]/.test(s);\n}\n```\n\n**Modified:**\n```ts\nfunction isHookName(s: string): boolean {\n  return /^use[A-Z0-9]/.test(s);\n}\n```\n\nThis resolved the false positive in my case.\n\n---\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nIdeally, the plugin should allow more flexibility and configurability — such as an option to exclude specific hook-like names (like `use`) from being treated as hooks. This would prevent conflicts with other libraries and reduce the need for manual patching.",

Added a test case (`refContext.js` and corresponding `.expect.md`) that demonstrates the pattern working correctly with the fix.\r\n\r\n2. The test case includes:\r\n   - A parent component that creates a ref and passes it through context\r\n   - A child component that retrieves the ref from context and mutates its `.current` property\r\n   - Both useEffect and event handler scenarios for the mutation\r\n\r\n3. Verified that with the fix, the compiler no longer throws the error when mutating the ref's current property.\r\n\r\n4. Manually tested with code that reproduces the issue reported in #31470, confirming that refs passed through context can now have their `.current` property mutated without triggering the error.\r\n\r\n5. Ran the compiler test suite to ensure no regressions were introduced.\r\n\r\nFixes: #31470",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\n-->\n\nReact version:19.0.0\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1 . Use the storeReducer function from the React playground context.\n\n2 . Dispatch an invalid or unknown action type to the reducer.\n\n3 . Observe that the reducer does not return a value (undefined), causing React to throw an error.\n\n<!--\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\n-->\n\nLink to code example:\nfunction storeReducer(store: Store, action: ReducerAction): Store {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case 'setStore': {\n      return action.payload.store;\n    }\n    case 'updateFile': {\n      return {\n        ...store,\n        source: action.payload.source,\n      };\n    }\n    //  No default case\n  }\n}\n\n<!--\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\n-->\nimport React, { useReducer } from \"react\";\n\ntype Store = {\n  source: string;\n};\n\ntype ReducerAction =\n  | { type: \"setStore\"; payload: { store: Store } }\n  | { type: \"updateFile\"; payload: { source: string } };\n\nconst storeReducer = (store: Store, action: ReducerAction): Store => {\n  switch (action.type) {\n    case \"setStore\":\n      return action.payload.store;\n    case \"updateFile\":\n      return { ...store, source: action.payload.source };\n    default:\n      return store; // Add default case\n  }\n};\n\nconst App = () => {\n  const [store, dispatch] = useReducer(storeReducer, { source: \"\" });\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={() => dispatch({ type: \"updateFile\", payload: { source: \"new source\" } })}>\n        Update File\n      </button>\n      <div>{store.source}</div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default App;\n\n## The current behavior\nWhen an unknown action type is dispatched (i.e., if there's no matching case in the switch statement), the reducer returns undefined, and React throws the error:\n\nReducer must return a valid state. Received undefined.\n\n\n## The expected behavior\nThe reducer should return a valid state for all cases, including an unknown action type. This can be achieved by adding a default case to handle unexpected actions:\n\ndefault:\n  return store; \n",

Something like that :\n\n```\nuseEffect(prev => {\n  console.log(prev)\n}, [dep1, dep2, dep3]\n\n//=> [ { name: 'dep1', prevValue: <value> }, { name: 'dep3', prevValue: <value>} ]\n```\n\nIf there is a better existing way to achieve the same thing, please tell me.",

What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\nCurrently, every time we insert a new style tag that has precedence, we first need to run 2 querySelectorAll calls. If we want to render 400 style tags, we'll need to run querySelectorAll 800 times. This is fairly slow.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, every time we encounter a new style tag react will create a new style tag in the DOM, and will (as far as I can tell) make no attempt to remove that style tag at any point. So the process of inserting itself will get slower as we insert more and more styles.\r\n\r\nWe can address the performance in this specific case by inserting nodes less often:\r\n- keep track of all our style tags based on their data-href and data-precedence values\r\n- the first time we acquire a style resource, query the DOM to populate our cache with any tags that may have been server rendered\r\n- if we already have a style node for a given href, we never need to insert a new style tag\r\n- if we already have a style node for a given precedence, we can append our new rule to the existing style tag instead of creating a new node\r\n- when possible, append new styles using [insertRule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleSheet/insertRule) to minimize the amount of parsing the browser needs to do. fall back to appending our style if needed (which is slow, but might be needed if inserting fails)\r\n\r\na few other random notes\r\n- this optimization is aimed at inserting nodes *less often*, but the actual process of inserting nodes is unchanged and still not that efficient. If you were to, for example, insert 400 stylesheet resources instead of 400 style resources you would encounter a performance issue (because those cannot be optimized in this way)\r\n- I would be interested to see react manage these styles better. perhaps using insertRule and deleteRule to remove/update styles rather than inserting them into the DOM forever. that would be beyond the scope of this PR, of course, but it bothers me that react makes no attempt to clean up these styles when components are unmounted.\r\n\r\nfixes #32806 \r\nfixes #30739 \r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\nI've built this version of react and patched it into a few projects that were having performance issues. I'm planning on doing this again (I've tweaked a few things) and will update these results when I've done that.\r\n\r\nin one such expensive render:\r\nthe entire process (including the browsers style recalculation) went from 2.11s to 504.34ms\r\nthe react portion of that process went from 1.47s to 26.91ms\r\nflushMutationEffects (the previously slow part) went from 1.45s to 7.58ms\r\n\r\nin one more extreme case:\r\nthe entire process (including the browsers style recalculation) went from 9.57s to 600.18ms\r\nthe react portion of that process went from 8.63s to 41.05ms\r\nflushMutationEffects (the previously slow part) went from 8.61s to 6.67ms\r\n\r\nThese two examples are obviously not fully comprehensive (I could fabricate a fairly comprehensive example case if anyone is interested) but they do roughly represent the level of improvement I've seen in my testing.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n",

In this case, a stream is returned early, and reading the stream will start flowing, so that enqueued chunks are flushed.\r\n\r\nWhen prerendering, flowing is only started when `onAllReady` is called. This was previously only done in `performWork`. However, if the root model is a rejected promise, `erroredTask` also needs to check if there are any abortable tasks left, and if there are none, it must call `onAllReady`. This ensures that the prerender doesn't hang, and a prelude stream is returned.\r\n\r\nIn addition, this fixes a bug where we returned the prelude early when a readable stream or async iterable were still in progress. The fix for this issue is to ensure that `abortListeners` is also empty before calling `onAllReady`.",

I believe it may be related to the way it changes the output react component code.\n\nI've created a minimal reproduction repository to demonstrate the issue:\n👉 https://github.com/ValentinGurkov/vitest-react-compiler-missing-coverage-repro, but I also want to share my findings here:\n\nThe button we are going to test is a simple one:\n```tsx\nexport const Button = () => {\n    return <button>Click me</button>;\n};\n```\n\nAs well as its test:\n```tsx\nimport { page } from '@vitest/browser/context';\nimport { Button } from '@repo/components/ui/button.js';\nimport { describe, expect, it} from 'vitest';\nimport { render } from 'vitest-browser-react';\n\ndescribe(Button, () => {\n    it('renders with default variants', async () => {\n        render(<Button />);\n\n        const button = page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Click me' });\n\n        await expect.element(button).toBeInTheDocument();\n    });\n});\n```\n\nThe coverage report with the React compiler turned on looks like:\n```pgsql\n   ✓  browser (chromium)  test/components/ui/button.test.tsx (1 test) 9ms\n   ✓ Button > renders with default variants 9ms\n\n Test Files  1 passed (1)\n      Tests  1 passed (1)\n   Start at  20:34:46\n   Duration  632ms (transform 0ms, setup 133ms, collect 28ms, tests 9ms, environment 0ms, prepare 93ms)\n\n % Coverage report from v8\n------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------\nFile        | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s \n------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------\nAll files   |     100 |       50 |     100 |     100 |                   \n button.tsx |     100 |       50 |     100 |     100 | 2                 \n------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------\n```\n\nThe component has no branching logic while the report shows are the are missing some. I believe I've managed to set up the `vitest` configuration to also log the transformed component and we have:\n\n```jsx\nimport { jsxDEV } from \"react/jsx-dev-runtime\";\nimport { c as _c } from \"react/compiler-runtime\";\nexport const Button = () => {\n  const $ = _c(1);\n  let t0;\n  if ($[0] === Symbol.for(\"react.memo_cache_sentinel\")) {\n    t0 = /* @__PURE__ */ jsxDEV(\"button\", { children: \"Click me\" }, void 0, false, {\n      fileName: \"/Users/<my-user>/Projects/vitest-react-compiler-coverage/src/components/ui/button.tsx\",\n      lineNumber: 6,\n      columnNumber: 10\n    }, this);\n    $[0] = t0;\n  } else {\n    t0 = $[0];\n  }\n  return t0;\n};\n```\n\nIt looks like the React compiler introduces a conditional for memoization purposes. That may explain the coverage issue, though it raises the question: is it even possible to get 100% branch coverage for components compiled like this?\n\nThe test without the React compiler looks like:\n```diff\n- react({\n- babel: {\n- plugins: [\n- [\"babel-plugin-react-compiler\", {}]\n- ],\n- },\n- }),\n+ react(),\n```\n```pgsql\n   ✓  browser (chromium)  test/components/ui/button.test.tsx (1 test) 10ms\n   ✓ Button > renders with default variants 10ms\n\n Test Files  1 passed (1)\n      Tests  1 passed (1)\n   Start at  20:36:42\n   Duration  490ms (transform 0ms, setup 36ms, collect 6ms, tests 10ms, environment 0ms, prepare 92ms)\n\n % Coverage report from v8\n------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------\nFile        | % Stmts | % Branch | % Funcs | % Lines | Uncovered Line #s \n------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------\nAll files   |     100 |      100 |     100 |     100 |                   \n button.tsx |     100 |      100 |     100 |     100 |                   \n------------|---------|----------|---------|---------|-------------------\n```\n\nThe code coverage is 100% as expected. The output code also has no conditions:\n```jsx\nimport { jsxDEV } from \"react/jsx-dev-runtime\";\nexport const Button = () => {\n  return /* @__PURE__ */ jsxDEV(\"button\", { children: \"Click me\" }, void 0, false, {\n    fileName: \"/Users/<my-user>/Projects/vitest-react-compiler-coverage/src/components/ui/button.tsx\",\n    lineNumber: 2,\n    columnNumber: 12\n  }, this);\n};\n```\n\n\nComing from https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/issues/7843#issuecomment-2812107855, it seems that babel's `auxiliaryCommentBefore` also does not have any effect on this.\n\nHow do we see test coverage working once the React Compiler becomes standard?\n\n\n### How often does this bug happen?\n\nEvery time\n\n### What version of React are you using?\n\n19.1.0\n\n### What version of React Compiler are you using?\n\n19.1.0-rc.1",

    "body": "React version: 19.1.0\n\nNot sure if this is considered a bug, but I recently updated one of my repos to React 19.1 and noticed different behavior regarding useEffect/useRef cleanup timing.\n\nWhen setting up a `ResizeObserver` callback in a `useEffect`, sometimes the resize callback is still called after the refs within the component have been destroyed. This can cause a `TypeError` when trying to access a null ref if not properly checked.\n\n**This only happens in the latest React 19.1, not in any previous versions.**\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Go to the CodeSandbox link: https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-issue-null-ref-kl7l7t\n2. Open the browser’s console tab\n3. Move the mouse on and off the button continuously — the error should appear shortly.\n\nHere’s a video link as well:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/651f7fd9-c163-479c-b242-38581cf7c91e\n \n\n## The expected behavior\n\nRefs attached to elements in the current component should not be null, as we expect them to be safe to access while the component is still mounted.\n\n## Use case background\n\nI'm building a tooltip that appears when hovering over an element. The tooltip’s content may update while it's displayed, so I use a `ResizeObserver` to monitor size changes and reposition the tooltip relative to the anchor element.\n\nWhile the issue can be easily avoided by checking if the ref is null, it could come as a surprise for people updating to React 19.1. Also thought it might indicate a recent regression in React itself.",
