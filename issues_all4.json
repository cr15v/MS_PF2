    "body": "Stacked on #32862 and #32842.\r\n\r\nThis means that Activity boundaries now act as boundaries which can have their effects mounted independently. Just like Suspense boundaries, we hydrate the outer content first and then start hydrating the content in an Offscreen lane. Flowing props or interacting with the content increases the priority just like Suspense boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis skips emitting even the comments for `<Activity mode=\"hidden\">` so we don't hydrate those. Instead those are deferred to a later client render.\r\n\r\nThe implementation are just forked copies of the SuspenseComponent branches and then carefully going through each line and tweaking it.\r\n\r\nThe main interesting bit is that, unlike Suspense, Activity boundaries don't have fallbacks so all those branches where you might commit a suspended tree disappears. Instead, if something suspends while hydration, we can just leave the dehydrated content in place. However, if something does suspend during client rendering then it should bubble up to the parent. Therefore, we have to be careful to only pushSuspenseHandler when hydrating. That's really the main difference.\r\n\r\nThis just uses the existing basic Activity tests but I've started work on port all of the applicable Suspense tests in SelectiveHydration-test and PartialHydration-test to Activity versions.",

Leaving it not prewarmed.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't happen in the simple case because we'd be hydrating at a higher priority than Offscreen at the root, and those are deferred to Offscreen by not having higher priority. However, we've hydrating at the Offscreen priority, which we do inside Suspense boundaries, then it tries to hydrate against an empty set.\r\n\r\nI ended up moving this to the Activity boundary in a future PR since it's the SSR side that decided where to not render something and it only has a concept of Activity, no Offscreen.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32863/commits/1dc05a5e2222e18fc3a2062ee1bd957109e21344#diff-d5166797ebbc5b646a49e6a06a049330ca617985d7a6edf3ad1641b43fde1ddfR1111",

At the moment, we're only considering default and discrete priorities, when there's a larger range of priorities available.\r\n\r\nIn Fabric, we'll test supporting additional priorities soon. For that test to do something useful, we need the new priorities to be mapped to reconciler priorities correctly, which is what this change is done.\r\n\r\n> [!IMPORTANT]\r\n> At the moment, this is a no-op because Fabric is only reporting default and discrete event priorities.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nWill test e2e on React Native on top of https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/50627\r\n\r\nThe changes are gated in React Native, so we'll use that feature flag to test this.\r\n",

    "body": "Behind the `enableSrcObject` flag. This is revisiting a variant of what was discussed in #11163.\r\n\r\nInstead of supporting the [`srcObject` property](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/srcObject) as a separate name, this adds an overload of `src` to allow objects to be passed. The DOM needs to add separate properties for the object forms since you read back but it doesn't make sense for React's write-only API to do that. Similar to how we'll like add an overload for `popoverTarget` instead of calling it `popoverTargetElement` and how `style` accepts an object and it's not `styleObject={{...}}`.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of reason to revisit this.\r\n\r\n- It's just way more convenient to have this built-in and it makes conceptual sense. We typically support declarative APIs and polyfill them when necessary.\r\n- RSC supports Blobs and by having it built-in you don't need a Client Component wrapper to render it where as doing it with effects would require more complex wrappers. By picking Blobs over base64, client-navigations can use the more optimized binary encoding in the RSC protocol.\r\n- The timing aspect of coordinating it with Suspensey images and image decoding is a bit tricky to get right because if you set it in an effect it's too late because you've already rendered it.\r\n- SSR gets complicated when done in user space because you have to handle both branches. Likely with `useSyncExternalStore`.\r\n- By having it built-in we could optimize the payloads shared between RSC payloads embedded in the HTML and data URLs.\r\n\r\nThis does not support objects for `<source src>` nor `<img srcset>`. Those don't really have equivalents in the DOM neither. They're mainly for picking an option when you don't know programmatically. However, for this use case you're really better off picking a variant before generating the blobs.\r\n\r\nWe may support Response objects in the future too as per https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/49",

In the future, it might not be trigger the exact set of internal circumstances anymore, but it could be useful for catching similar bugs because it represents a realistic real world situation — namely, switching tabs repeatedly in an app that uses useDeferredValue.",

So this uses `<ViewTransition>` as an early opt-in for that tree into Suspensey Images, which we can ship in a minor.\r\n\r\nIf you're doing an update inside a ViewTransition then we're eligible to start a ViewTransition in any Transition that might suspend. Even if that doesn't end up animating after all, we still consider it Suspensey. We could try to suspend inside the startViewTransition but that's not how it would work with `enableSuspenseyImages` on and we can't do that for startGestureTransition.\r\n\r\nEven so we still need some opt-in to trigger the Suspense fallback even before we know whether we'll animate or not. So the simple solution is just that `<ViewTransition>` opts in the whole subtree into Suspensey Images in general.\r\n\r\nIn this PR I disable `enableSuspenseyImages` in experimental so that we can instead test the path that only enables it inside `<ViewTransition>` tree since that's the path that would next graduate to a minor.",

This is added both to the render phase, mutation effect phase, layout effect phase and passive effect phase.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"962\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 10 41 02 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13777347-07e8-458c-9127-8675ef08b54f\" />\r\n\r\nIdeally we could probably give an annotation to the component instead of adding a whole other line which is also a color that's kind of distracting. However, not all components are included and keeping track of which one is the first one below is kind of annoying. Adding a marker to all components is kind of noisy. So this is a compromise. It's only one per depth so it won't make it too deep even on larger trees.\r\n\r\nIf this is an unmount, those are added to the mutation effect phase for the layout unmounts and passive unmount effect phase. Since these never have a render, they're not in the render phase.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1010\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-04-03 at 11 05 57 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ab39f27e-13be-4281-94fa-9391bb293fd2\" />\r\n\r\nFor showing / hiding `<Activity>` the terminology \"Reconnect\" and \"Disconnect\" is used instead.",

Which lead to most effects not having their components logged since they almost always have children.\r\n\r\nWe don't necessarily have to push/pop but we have to store at least one thing on the stack unfortunately. That's because we have to do the actual log after the children to get the right end time. So might as well use the push/pop strategy like the rest of them.",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\n-->\n\n**React version:**  \n18.2.0 (reproduced in latest 19.1 as well)\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThere is [an open issue](https://github.com/reactjs/react.dev/issues/7317) proposing documentation updates around the use of `flushSync` with `createRoot().render()` to enforce synchronous rendering. However, since that issue has gone without feedback for several months, and given the core behavior observed, I suspect this may be an actual bug in React rather than just a documentation gap. I'm opening this issue here in the main React repository to clarify whether this behavior is intentional or not.\n\n---\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Render a basic React app using `createRoot(...).render(<App />)`.\n2. Inside `<App />`, log messages from `useLayoutEffect` and `useEffect`.\n3. Log messages before and after `root.render()` call.\n4. Compare behavior between:\n   - `createRoot(...).render(...)` (modern API)\n   - `flushSync(() => root.render(...))`\n   - Legacy `ReactDOM.render(...)`\n\n---\n\n**Link to code example:**  [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-and-synchronous-react-render-jkpcz7?file=%2Fsrc%2Findex.js)\n\n---\n\n## The current behavior\n\nUsing `createRoot(...).render(...)` without wrapping in `flushSync`, we observe that:\n\n- The log inside `useLayoutEffect` is emitted **after** `console.log(\"Post root.render\")`, indicating the effect happens *after* the render call resolves.\n- In contrast, using `flushSync(() => root.render(...))` or legacy `ReactDOM.render(...)`, `useLayoutEffect` is called *before* the post-render log.\n\nThis suggests the modern root API allows post-render behavior to interleave with layout effects, even outside of explicitly opted-in concurrent features. This might violate expectations around synchronous behavior of the initial render.\n\n---\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nAs [@rickhanlonii](https://github.com/rickhanlonii) noted in a related discussion, the initial render should be synchronous by default. If that’s the case, this behavior seems inconsistent.\n\n- `createRoot(...).render(...)` should preserve layout effect timing consistency with legacy `ReactDOM.render(...)`, without needing to wrap in `flushSync`.\n- If the current behavior is intentional, it would help to explicitly document that `createRoot(...).render(...)` may be async under certain conditions—even without concurrent features being enabled.\n",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\n-->\n\nReact version: 19.0.0, 19.1.0\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n\n1. Render at least two precedence levels, for example 'a' and 'b' so that react can insert our stylesheets into the head rather than inline.\n2. Render lots of style elements into 'a' (your first precedence level, the important part is that react inserts our stylesheets into the head) and observe performance. Compare this to rendering without any precedence at all.\n\n<!--\n  Your bug will get fixed much faster if we can run your code and it doesn't\n  have dependencies other than React. Issues without reproduction steps or\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\n-->\n\nLink to code example:\n\n<!--\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\n-->\n\nHere's a codesandbox demonstrating the basic issue:\nhttps://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-style-perf-t7w9qr\nOr a github repository, if you prefer:\nhttps://github.com/RJWadley/react-style-perf\n\n## The current behavior\n\nSeems like each style tag is handled independently with very little optimization - which is probably fine if you only load one or two stylesheets but doesn't work well for larger amounts of styling. In the attached example, you should also notice that every time we toggle our styles with precedence our performance gets worse and worse.\n\n<details>\n<summary>\nHere's a real example of render performance on my M1 mac pro. This isn't from the attached example, but is the same issue just at a larger scale:\n</summary>\n\n<img width=\"759\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/70a25e71-7d83-491d-8804-e5eace03b1e4\" />\n\nZooming in, most of the performance hit seems to come from query selectors and from actually inserting each stylesheet.\n<img width=\"1497\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/393c6d5a-c338-4ad5-801e-395851ebaab5\" />\n</details>\n\n## The expected behavior\n\nStylesheets should ideally render in similar time regardless of precedence.\n\nRelated: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/30739",

Please test using the latest version of the relevant\n  React packages to make sure your issue has not already been fixed.\n-->\n\nReact version: 19.1.0\n\nWe're currently upgrading from React 18 -> 19 and we're noticing what appears to be a slight change in the how `renderToPipeableStream` works. Specifically around the `</body></html>` being sent down as a separate chunk once all suspended content has been rendered. \n\nMostly curious if this an expected change? I went through the [changelog](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#1900-december-5-2024) but couldn't find anything that pointed to this.\n\n**Context** \nDuring server render, we discover \"dynamic content\" (image preload URLs, lazy load scripts, etc) and inject them into the response stream using a technique very similar to [this](https://github.com/reactwg/react-18/discussions/114). To ensure we don't start injecting too early, we will wait until the initial shell has been streamed down before we start injecting the dynamic content into the stream. \n\nWe noticed after upgrading to React 19, our previous assumptions were no longer valid since dynamic  content was now being injected incorrectly between partial html.\n\n## Steps To Reproduce\n1. Render a full HTML document (containing _something_ that suspends) using `renderToPipeableStream`. \nEx:\n```\n<html lang=\"en\">\n  <head />\n  <body>\n    <Suspense fallback={<div>hello</div>}>\n        <ThingThatSuspends />\n     </Suspense>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n2.  Confirm that in React 18.3, `</body></html>` is sent as part of the initial chunk _before_ `ThingThatSuspends` renders. Confirm in React 19, its sent down as a separate chunk _after_ `ThingThatSuspends` renders. \n",

    "body": "Stacked on #32793.\r\n\r\nThis is meant to model the intended semantics of `addTransitionType` better. The previous hack just consumed all transition types when any root committed so it could steal them from other roots. Really each root should get its own set. Really each transition lane should get its own set.\r\n\r\nWe can't implement the full ideal semantics yet because 1) we currently entangle transition lanes 2) we lack `AsyncContext` on the client so for async actions we can't associate a `addTransitionType` call to a specific `startTransition`.\r\n\r\nThis starts by modeling Transition Types to be stored on the Transition instance. Conceptually they belong to the Transition instance of that `startTransition` they belong to. That instance is otherwise mostly just used for Transition Tracing but it makes sense that those would be able to be passed the Transition Types for that specific instance.\r\n\r\nNested `startTransition` need to get entangled. So that this `addTransitionType` can be associated with the `setState`:\r\n\r\n```js\r\nstartTransition(() => {\r\n  startTransition(() => {\r\n    addTransitionType(...)\r\n  });\r\n  setState(...);\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\nIdeally we'd probably just use the same Transition instance itself since these are conceptually all part of one entangled one. But transition tracing uses multiple names and start times. Unclear what we want to do with that. So I kept separate instances but shared `types` set.\r\n\r\nNext I collect the types added during a `startTransition` to any root scheduled with a Transition. This should really be collected one set per Transition lane in a `LaneMap`. In fact, the information would already be there if Transition Tracing was always enabled because it tracks all Transition instances per lane. For now I just keep track of one set for all Transition lanes. Maybe we should only add it if a `setState` was done on this root in this particular `startTransition` call rather having already scheduled any Transition earlier.\r\n\r\nWhile async transitions are entangled, we don't know if there will be a startTransition+setState on a new root in the future. Therefore, we collect all transition types while this is happening and if a new root gets startTransition+setState they get added to that root. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nstartTransition(async () => {\r\n  addTransitionType(...)\r\n  await ...;\r\n  setState(...);\r\n});\r\n```",

However, we can keep track if there are any async transitions running at all, and if not, warn. This should cover most cases.\r\n\r\nThis also errors when inside a React render which might be a legit way to associate a Transition Type to a specific render (e.g. based on props changing) but we want to be a more conservative about allowing that yet. If we wanted to support calling it in render, we might want to set which Transition object is currently rendering but it's still tricky if the render has `async function` components. So it might at least be restricted to sync components (like Hooks).",

This unfortunately also means it's possible to call outside of `startTransition` which is something we want to warn for.\r\n\r\nWe need to be able to distinguish whether `addTransitionType` is for a regular Transition or a Gesture Transition though.\r\n\r\nSince `startGestureTransition` is only synchronous we can track it within that execution scope and move it to a separate set. Since we know for sure which call owns it we can properly associate it with that specific provider's `ScheduledGesture`.\r\n\r\nThis does not yet handle calling `addTransitionType` inside the render phase of a gesture. That would currently still be associated with the next Transition instead.",

Except since we are playing animations in reverse, the animation-delay is actually applied from the range end and then the duration from there to get closer to the start.\r\n\r\nReverse the range if the original animation was reversed.\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the range it takes can be adjusted by what is in the viewport since if a long duration animation is excluded then everything else adjusts too.\r\n\r\nI left some todos too.

Issues without reproduction steps or\n  code examples may be immediately closed as not actionable.\n-->\n\nLink to code example:\n```jsx\nfunction App() {\n  for (const item of items) {\n    useSomething(item); // error\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```jsx\nfunction App() {\n  for (const item of items) {\n    use(item); // no error\n  }\n}\n```\n\n<!--\n  Please provide a CodeSandbox (https://codesandbox.io/s/new), a link to a\n  repository on GitHub, or provide a minimal code example that reproduces the\n  problem. You may provide a screenshot of the application if you think it is\n  relevant to your bug report. Here are some tips for providing a minimal\n  example: https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve.\n-->\n\n## The current behavior\nCalling useSomething() inside a loop triggers a lint error:\n\nReact Hook \"useSomething\" may be executed more than once. Possibly because it is called in a loop.\n\nBut calling use() inside the same loop does not trigger an error.\n\n\n## The expected behavior\nReact 19 allows use(promise) to be called in a loop, but eslint-plugin-react-hooks only allows use(), not custom hooks like useSomething().\n\nSince React 19’s implementation no longer treats use() as special by name, ESLint should ideally match this behavior and allow user-defined useSomething() calls in the same pattern, or clearly define why use() is a special case.\n\n",

    "body": "Stacked on #32783. This will replace [the `useSwipeTransition` API](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32373). \r\n\r\nInstead, of a special Hook, you can make updates to `useOptimistic` Hooks within the `startGestureTransition` scope.\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport {unstable_startGestureTransition as startGestureTransition} from 'react';\r\n\r\nconst cancel = startGestureTransition(timeline, () => {\r\n  setOptimistic(...);\r\n}, options);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are some downsides to this like you can't define two directions as once and there's no \"standard\" direction protocol. It's instead up to libraries to come up with their own conventions (although we can suggest some).\r\n\r\nThe convention is still that a gesture recognizer has two props `action` and `gesture`. The `gesture` prop is a Gesture concept which now behaves more like an Action but 1) it can't be async 2) it shouldn't have side-effects. For example you can't call `setState()` in it except on `useOptimistic` since those can be reverted if needed. The `action` is invoked with whatever side-effects you want after the gesture fulfills.\r\n\r\nThis is isomorphic and not associated with a specific renderer nor root so it's a bit more complicated.\r\n\r\nTo implement this I unify with the `ReactSharedInternal.T` property to contain a regular Transition or a Gesture Transition (the `gesture` field). The benefit of this unification means that every time we override this based on some scope like entering `flushSync` we also override the `startGestureTransition` scope. We just have to be careful when we read it to check the `gesture` field to know which one it is. (E.g. I error for setState / requestFormReset.)\r\n\r\nThe other thing that's unique is the `cancel` return value to know when to stop the gesture. That cancellation is no longer associated with any particular Hook. It's more associated with the scope of the `startGestureTransition`. Since the schedule of whether a particular gesture has rendered or committed is associated with a root, we need to somehow associate any scheduled gestures with a root.\r\n\r\nWe could track which roots we update inside the scope but instead, I went with a model where I check all the roots and see if there's a scheduled gesture matching the timeline. This means that you could \"retain\" a gesture across roots. Meaning this wouldn't cancel until both are cancelled:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconst cancelA = startGestureTransition(timeline, () => {\r\n  setOptimisticOnRootA(...);\r\n}, options);\r\n\r\nconst cancelB = startGestureTransition(timeline, () => {\r\n  setOptimisticOnRootB(...);\r\n}, options);\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt's more like it's a global transition than associated with the roots that were updated.\r\n\r\nOptimistic updates mostly just work but I now associate them with a specific \"ScheduledGesture\" instance since we can only render one at a time and so if it's not the current one, we leave it for later.\r\n\r\nClean up of optimistic updates is now lazy rather than when we cancel. Allowing the cancel closure not to have to be associated with each particular update.",

    "body": "The problem with setting both `children` or `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` and also using a ref on a DOM node to either manually append children or using it as a Container for `createRoot` or `createPortal` is that it's ambiguous which children should win. Ideally you use one of the four options to control children. Meaning that ideally you always use a leaf container for refs like this.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately it's very common to use a React owned thing with children as a Container of a Portal. For example `document.body` can have both regular React children and be used as a Portal container. This isn't really fully supported and has some undefined behavior like relative order isn't guaranteed but still very common.\r\n\r\nIt is extra bad if the children are a `string`/`number` or if `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is set. Because then when ever that reactively updates it'll clear out any manually added DOM nodes. When this happens isn't guaranteed. It's always happening as far as the reactivity is concerned. See https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31600\r\n\r\nTherefore, we should warn for this specific pattern. This still allows non-text children as a compromise even though that behavior is also somewhat undefined.",

    "body": "Portals and `<ViewTransition>` are tricky because they leave the React tree. You might think of a Portal's container conceptually as also being part of a React tree but that's not quite how they're modeled today. They're more like their own roots. So instead, of trying to find a conceptual place in the React tree we treat Portals as their own root.\r\n\r\nWe have two ways of tracking whether an update to a ViewTransition boundary has occurred. Either a DOM mutation has happened within it, or a resize of a child has caused it to potentially relayout its parent. Normally that just follows the tree structure of React, but not when it's a Portal.\r\n\r\nWhen it's a Portal we don't know which DOM parent it might have affected. For all we know it's at the root (and in fact, in most cases that's where Portals go).\r\n\r\nWith this PR we mark the root as having been affected by a mutation or resize. This means that the whole document will animate and we can't optimize away from it. This ensures that a mutation to the root of a Portal doesn't go unanimated with other things are animating such as its parent.\r\n\r\nYou can regain this optimization by adding a `<ViewTransition>` boundary directly inside the Portal itself so it owns its own animation. If that DOM node is also absolutely positioned it doesn't leak.\r\n\r\nConversely this also means that a mutation inside a Portal doesn't affect its React parent so it won't trigger its parent's animation if this was the only thing animating. That could be unfortunate if this container is actually inside the same React parent. However, because this would have been an update we would've marked it for \"maybe animating\" and updates can't only get their animations cancelled if the root is cancelled, in practice this will actually animate anyway.",

    "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses [#31237](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/31237), where **`eslint-plugin-react-hooks`** incorrectly flagged *any* local function named `use` as if it were `React.use`. This caused false positives in non-React code, for example:\r\n\r\n```js\r\n// Example in a Playwright test fixture:\r\nconst test = base.extend({\r\n  track: async ({}, use) => {\r\n    await use(track);\r\n    // Previously: \"React Hook 'use' is called in function...\"\r\n  },\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- **Import tracking**: We now detect whether `{ use }` or React/MyReact is imported from 'react'.\r\n- `isHook()` **updated**:\r\n  * A bare `use()` is only flagged if `{ use }` is actually imported from 'react'.\r\n  * `React.useXYZ` or `MyReact.useXYZ` is recognized as a Hook only if React/MyReact is indeed a 'react' import.\r\n- **False positives removed**: Local utility or parameter use no longer triggers Hook errors.\r\n- **Backward compatibility**: Real React Hooks remain enforced with no changes to usage or ordering rules.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nThese changes remove lint errors for local `use()` usage in non-React contexts (e.g., Playwright, test utilities) while preserving the integrity of React Hook rules for actual `use()` calls from 'react'.\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n- Existing suite: All current tests passed without regression.\r\n- Added a new test verifying that local usage of use() does not trigger the rule, while use() imported from 'react' continues to be enforced.\r\n- Project checks: Used yarn test, yarn lint, yarn flow, etc., with no issues.\r\n\r\n> Tests will be pushed in the following commit and the PR will be converted from the Draft state.",

This means that untransformed callsites should escalate to a build error.\n\n`ValidateNoUntransformedReferences` iterates 'special effect' callsites and checks that the compiler was able to successfully transform them. Prior to this PR, this relied on checking the number of arguments passed to this special effect.\n\nThis obviously doesn't work with `noEmit: true`, which is used for our eslint plugin (this avoids mutating the babel program as other linters run with the same ast). This PR adds a set of `babel.SourceLocation`s to do best effort matching in this mode.\n",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10. If you haven't already, complete the CLA.\r\n\r\n  Learn more about contributing: https://reactjs.org/docs/how-to-contribute.html\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## Summary\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/32550 the modulex.exports was rewritten to `export` functionality.\r\n\r\nHowever this removed the ability to do `import reactCompiler from \"eslint-plugin-react-compiler\"` as described in the readme.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n Explain the **motivation** for making this change. What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\n",

Please provide enough information so that others can review your pull request. The three fields below are mandatory.\r\n\r\n  Before submitting a pull request, please make sure the following is done:\r\n\r\n  1. Fork [the repository](https://github.com/facebook/react) and create your branch from `main`.\r\n  2. Run `yarn` in the repository root.\r\n  3. If you've fixed a bug or added code that should be tested, add tests!\r\n  4. Ensure the test suite passes (`yarn test`). Tip: `yarn test --watch TestName` is helpful in development.\r\n  5. Run `yarn test --prod` to test in the production environment. It supports the same options as `yarn test`.\r\n  6. If you need a debugger, run `yarn test --debug --watch TestName`, open `chrome://inspect`, and press \"Inspect\".\r\n  7. Format your code with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (`yarn prettier`).\r\n  8. Make sure your code lints (`yarn lint`). Tip: `yarn linc` to only check changed files.\r\n  9. Run the [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) type checks (`yarn flow`).\r\n  10.

What existing problem does the pull request solve?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n- ⚠️ I don't know exactly how to reproduce the bug, my only evidence that this problem exists is my error logs.\r\n- **It looks like the fiber tree hits the end and we are not checking this** \r\n- Versions that my application uses `react@19.0.0` and `react-dom@19.0.0`.\r\n- I got some logs from my application with the following stack trace, it was caught 4 times until now from my ErrorBoundary.\r\n\r\n```\r\n  | Attributes.metadata.stack.0 | webpack://_N_E/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.production.js:7481:0\r\n  | Attributes.metadata.stack.1 | webpack://_N_E/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.production.js:8940:0\r\n  | Attributes.metadata.stack.2 | webpack://_N_E/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.production.js:8915:0\r\n  | Attributes.metadata.stack.3 | webpack://_N_E/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.production.js:9034:0\r\n  | Attributes.metadata.stack.4 | webpack://_N_E/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.production.js:8915:0\r\n  | Attributes.metadata.stack.5 | webpack://_N_E/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.production.js:9034:0\r\n  | Attributes.metadata.stack.6 | webpack://_N_E/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.production.js:8915:0\r\n  | Attributes.metadata.stack.7 | webpack://_N_E/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.production.js:8934:0\r\n  | Attributes.metadata.stack.8 | webpack://_N_E/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.production.js:8915:0\r\n  | Attributes.metadata.stack.9 | webpack://_N_E/node_modules/react-dom/cjs/react-dom-client.production.js:8934:0\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter checking the react code base, and the code generated from the `react-dom-client.production` version, I made the change on the `lastEffect.next` to ensure that it will have a value before enter the `do while`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## How did you test this change?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n  Demonstrate the code is solid. Example: The exact commands you ran and their output, screenshots / videos if the pull request changes the user interface.\r\n  How exactly did you verify that your PR solves the issue you wanted to solve?\r\n  If you leave this empty, your PR will very likely be closed.\r\n-->\r\nI did the following steps:\r\n- I ran the `yarn test` command\r\n- I ran the `yarn test --prod` command\r\n- I ran the `yarn linc` command\r\n",
